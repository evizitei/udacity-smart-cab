# Smartcab Submission Report


## After Random Action implementation

#### QUESTION: Observe what you see with the agent's behavior as it takes random actions. Does the smartcab eventually make it to the destination? Are there any other interesting observations to note?

So far, the cab (as expected) moves about at random.  Sometimes it happens
upon a waypoint, and I imagine with sufficient running time and no obstacles
it will always _eventually_ hit the waypoint given infinite time,
but there's also no assurance that it will do so within any finite timeline
no matter how large you make it.
